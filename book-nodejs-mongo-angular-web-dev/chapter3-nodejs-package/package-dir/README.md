Ode to `censormepls`: The Art of Word Cleansing

Indeed, I shall compose with words so fine,
In elegance, just like the divine.
For thou seek'st knowledge, so 'tis mine to give,
In sonnet form, to help thee be creative.

If from harsh words thou seek'st to be free,
Install 'tis package `censormepls` thee see.
In thy console of Node, type jest and clear,
Mind not the jargon, have no fear.

When thy quill has bled lines of code,
One can execute it in thy abode.
Right in the console, type with care,
Run `npm install`, and leave it there.

In thy application, import it neat,
`Censor` from `censormepls`, oh so fleet.

Harsh words no more, nowhere to be seen.

Errors and glitches, it'll help thee brush off.
On the green pastures of thy console wide,
Thou'll see the results swift as the tide.

Thy audience praises, loves they'll send.
Using `censormepls`, tis no facade,
Thou art ready, my friend, with applause and applaud.
